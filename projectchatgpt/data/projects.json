    "description": "This lakeside residence embodies the principles of minimalist architecture while responding sensitively to its natural setting. The design features clean lines, large overhangs for weather protection, and expansive glazing that blurs the boundary between interior and exterior spaces. The project challenged us to create a modern home that feels integrated with the landscape rather than imposed upon it. Sustainable design strategies include natural ventilation, solar orientation optimization, and the use of locally sourced materials. The result is a tranquil retreat that celebrates both architectural clarity and environmental harmony.",

    "description": "This boutique hotel interior project presented the unique challenge of honoring Goan architectural heritage while creating spaces that appeal to contemporary luxury travelers. The design narrative weaves together traditional Portuguese colonial elements with modern Indian craftsmanship, creating an authentic yet sophisticated atmosphere. Custom furniture pieces were developed in collaboration with local artisans, celebrating regional woodworking techniques and materials. The color palette draws inspiration from Goan sunsets and spices, implemented through carefully curated textiles, artwork, and lighting design. Each guest room tells a story of place while providing modern amenities and comfort. The project demonstrates how thoughtful interior design can create economic opportunities for local craftspeople while delivering an exceptional hospitality experience.",
